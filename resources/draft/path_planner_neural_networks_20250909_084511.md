**Note on Time Estimates:**
*   The daily breakdown provides a structured pace. Learners should feel free to spend more or less time on specific topics based on their understanding and interest.
*   "Project Work" days are crucial for applying knowledge. Learners can choose projects aligned with their interests (e.g., NLP, Computer Vision, etc.).
*   The "Additional Recommended Resources" can be used as alternatives or supplementary material if a primary resource is not suitable for a learner.
